# Side-Project-Scheduling-system

## Motivation
Since the day 03.28.2024, I have visited NTUST's Career Fair.
I noticed something important: side projects showcase more objective coding and problem-solving abilities.
This inspires me to develop side projects not only for my own demonstration but also for a better way to learn.

## What is this Side Project for?
When I was studying for my master's degree, I had a part-time job at a brunch store where the boss was also my friend.
It was quite annoying to schedule shifts repeatedly, considering various constraints such as absences or some part-time employees having big exams.
Therefore, I decided to develop a scheduling system as a side project, not only to help my friends but also to learn how to solve this unique issue.
